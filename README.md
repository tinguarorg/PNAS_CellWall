# PNAS_CellWall
The Python code in "PNAS code.py" carries out the cross-validation process of the CRT models described in the paper "Arabidopsis cell wall composition determines disease resistance specificity and fitness" submitted to PNAS. The data on which the process works is supplied as supplementary material of the paper (data set 2).
